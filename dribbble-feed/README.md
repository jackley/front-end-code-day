## Project Overview

This is a [Dynamit](http://dynamit.com) Code Day challenge. Job candidates are provided this code and a set of requirements (in-person). They have **2 - 3h** to bring this code to completion, and then present their work to a group of their future colleagues.

Savvy candidates will download and experiment with this project prior to arriving at Dynamit. They'll have an opportunity to ask questions and to get pointed in the right direction if something is unclear.

This exercise in evaluating a candidate's ability to:

- Read and fulfill functional requirements
- Consume APIs
- Write event-driven JavaScript
- Work with modern tooling (Gulp, Webpack, Sass)
- Jump into someone else's code
- Polish a design
